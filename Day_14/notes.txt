cluster 
mogodb is just application layer that manges the database

bahut saare server aapas mei milke cluster banate hain



 const findResult = await collection.find({}); when we don't write toArray();
 => connection.find() ne network call kari hi nhii as by removing await we get the same answer
 // now the question who is doing the work of network call

 const findResult = collection.find({});
 const ans = await findResult.toArray();
 console.log('Found documnets => ', ans);

 now we get the answer. Now the question is it toArray() is doing this work?? why collection.find() didin't did it and why collection.find() is named as cursor??

 // toArray() calls the network and jitna bhi documnets us collection mei hai wo sabke uthake ek arrray mei rakhta hai and then return krta hain
 // and this is a very dangerous operation. suppose we have data of 5gb in the collection then whole 5gb array comes to the RAM and the Ram ki band baj jaayegi.
 // isi se bachane ke liye cursor diya gya hain. cursor menas it simply points to the document one by one 
 

 // now if we want that one by one document comes to the backend. then we can do this 
   const findResult = collection.find({});
   for await(const doc of findResult)
    console.log(doc); 
    // when we write in this formast then it calls the netowrk


Lets move to mongoose
