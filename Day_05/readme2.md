# Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

## Introduction
This document explains the differences between **Monolithic** and **Microservices** architectures, their advantages, disadvantages, and when to use each.

---

## Monolithic Architecture
### **What is Monolithic Architecture?**
Monolithic architecture is a software design where all components (Frontend, Backend, Database, Authentication, Payment Service, etc.) are bundled together in a single codebase and deployed as one unit.

### **Example**
An **E-commerce Website** where:
- Frontend, Backend, Database, Payment Service, and Image Storage are in one server.

### **Pros of Monolithic Architecture**
‚úÖ **Simple Deployment** - Everything is in one place.
‚úÖ **Easy Debugging** - Errors can be traced easily.
‚úÖ **Lower Cost** - Only one server is needed.
‚úÖ **Less Complexity** - No need for service-to-service communication.

### **Cons of Monolithic Architecture**
‚ùå **Scalability Issues** - Hard to scale a single component.
‚ùå **Tech Stack Limitation** - The whole application must use the same technology.
‚ùå **Risk of Full Failure** - If one component crashes, the whole system fails.
‚ùå **Difficult Maintenance** - As the application grows, it becomes harder to manage.

## Microservices Architecture
### **What is Microservices Architecture?**
Microservices architecture breaks down an application into smaller, independent services, each running separately on different servers and communicating via APIs.

### **Example**
An **E-commerce Website** with:
- **Frontend Service** (React, Vue.js)
- **Backend Service** (Node.js, Java, Python)
- **Database Service** (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- **Payment Service** (Stripe, PayPal)
- **Authentication Service** (OAuth, JWT)

### **Pros of Microservices Architecture**
‚úÖ **Scalability** - Scale individual services independently.
‚úÖ **Tech Stack Flexibility** - Each service can use different technologies.
‚úÖ **Fault Isolation** - Failure in one service does not crash the entire system.
‚úÖ **Faster Updates** - Update one service without affecting others.

### **Cons of Microservices Architecture**
‚ùå **Higher Cost** - Multiple servers are required.
‚ùå **Complex Deployment** - Each service must be deployed separately.
‚ùå **Difficult Debugging** - Hard to trace errors across services.
‚ùå **Network Latency** - Services communicate over the network, adding delays.

## **Comparison: Monolithic vs. Microservices**
| Feature            | Monolithic | Microservices |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Codebase**       | Single codebase | Multiple codebases |
| **Tech Stack**     | One technology | Multiple technologies |
| **Scalability**    | Hard to scale | Easy to scale |
| **Deployment**     | Simple | Complex |
| **Maintenance**    | Easier | Harder |
| **Bug Fixing**     | Easier | Harder |
| **Failure Impact** | Full app crashes | Only one service crashes |
| **Cost**          | Lower | Higher |

## **How Services Communicate in Microservices?**
Microservices use **two common methods** to communicate:
1. **REST API (HTTP Requests)** - Services communicate using URLs like `https://backend.com/getProducts`.
2. **Message Queue (Asynchronous Communication)** - Services send messages via tools like RabbitMQ or Kafka.

## **Which One Should You Choose?**
- **For Small Applications** - Use **Monolithic** (simple and cost-effective).
- **For Large Applications** - Use **Microservices** (scalable and flexible).
